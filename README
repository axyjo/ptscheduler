==Information==

PTScheduler is a web-based scheduling application that allows parents, teachers
and administrators to schedule appointments for a parent-teacher conference
without the need to fill out forms or call in. It is intended to minimize the
amount of input needed by a school secretary into the data system of the
school.

==Licensing==

==Requirements==

PTScheduler requires the following components:
 - a web server (Apache 2.0 or similar)
 - PHP 5 (5.2 or greater)
 - a database engine compatible with your PDO installation and its extensions

==Installation==

 1. Copy the default.config.php to config.php.

 2. Change the appropriate settings within the config.php file. These include
the security hash, list of teachers and administrators and the date and time
constraints.

 3. Ensure that a database engine is installed and edit the $db_url variable
in config.php to match your settings.
 
 4. Change permissions on the config.php file so that all write privileges have
been revoked. Leaving write privileges on this file is a security vulnerability
as users may be able to deface your site.

If using an sqlite database, please ensure that the web server user has write
privileges on the database file.
